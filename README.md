# AEM-Healthcare-Analytics

This repository contains analytics report for an interactive Power BI analytics project that provides insights into hospital operations, patient demographics, disease distribution, and treatment patterns. The dashboard enables analysis of patient admissions, condition severity, and healthcare utilization through KPIs, trends, and comparative visuals to support data-driven hospital management.

## Executive Overview

### Overall Insight

Admissions are stable with balanced demographics, rising health demand as age-group progresses, and efficient patient turnover, with a notable year-end dip requiring review.

### Key Metrics

- Total Patients: 25,000 (+4.2% MoM overall growth in admissions)
- Average Stay: 4 days (Reflects efficient patient turnover)
- Age Groups: 8
- Doctors: 8 | Nurses: 5 | Departments: 5

### Admissions Trend

- Monthly admissions are stable (~2,200) across most of the year.
- Peak months: March & October.
- December drops sharply (1,018) – likely seasonal

### Patient Demographics
- Gender distribution is balanced:
 - Other: 33.57%
 - Female: 33.34%
 - Male: 33.08%

### Disease & Treatment Insights

- Top conditions: Anxiety, Arthritis, Food Poisoning, Depression.
- Mental health cases are a major driver of admissions.
- Treatments are mostly non-invasive:
 - Therapy, Rehabilitation, Medication, Observation dominate.
 - Surgery in other more serious cases like Thyroid Disorder, Epilepsy, Liver Disease, CKD, Stroke.

### Age Group Patterns

- Youth, Senior Citizens and Mature Adult patients account for most admissions.
- Children and Toddlers show the lowest disease incidence.
- Chronic diseases like Depression, Dermatitis, Heart, Liver, Parkinson, Stroke increase with age, but generally, most disease are even more prevalent in youths, making them the overall admitted and in terms of any disease.

### Summary

- Hospital operations are efficient (4-day average stay).
- Mental health (Anxiety, Depression) and chronic care require sustained focus.
- December anomaly should be reviewed.

## Patient Overview

### Overall Insight

Patient demand is balanced across demographics, severity levels, and treatments, with mental health and routine care driving most hospital interactions.

### Key Metrics

- Total Patients: 25,000 (+4.2% MoM)
- Average Stay: 4 days
- Average Patient Age: 45
- Disease Types: 30
- Occupation Types: 8

### Patient Demographics

- Marital Status: Evenly distributed
  - Married: 34.12%
  - Single: 33.04%
  - Divorced: 32.84%

- Gender: Disease distribution is balanced across Male, Female, and Other, with no extreme dominance.

- Condition Severity
  - Mild: 33.39%
  - Moderate: 33.36%
  - Severe: 33.26%

 This indicates uniform case complexity and consistent care demand.

### Disease Insights

- Most common conditions: Anxiety, Arthritis, Food Poisoning, Allergy, Depression.
- Mental health (Anxiety) shows high prevalence across genders and marital statuses signalling attention. Slightly more pronounced in divorced patients.
- Disease distribution is consistent across Gender, Marital Status and Occupation segments, suggesting broad exposure rather than peculiar to a niche or risk groups.

### Occupation-Based Patterns

- Insignificantly higher disease incidence among:
  - Nurses
  - Engineers
  - Traders (being top 3)

Likely linked to high-contact or high-stress occupations (this margin is slight and not significant).

## Treatment & Visit Patterns

Treatment types evenly distributed:
 - Rehabilitation, Observation, Medication, Therapy, Surgery (~20% each)
- Top reasons for hospital visits:
 - Lab Tests (20.1%)
 - Follow-ups (20.08%)
 - Medication Review (19.95%)
 - Emergency & Checkups (~20% each)

### Summary

- Patient population is demographically balanced
- Disease severity is evenly spread, aiding predictable capacity planning
- Mental health conditions remain a major demand driver
- Non-invasive treatments dominate overall care
